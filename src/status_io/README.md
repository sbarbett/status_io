Creating and resolving incidents from within Zendesk.

### To do:

* Move the create incident form to a pop-out modal
* Add the remaining "notify" options
* Store the resulting incident ID within the ticket somewhere
* If an incident is associated with the ticket, display that info within the app panel
* Add a way to update and resolve the existing incident from Zendesk
* If the ticket is resolved, auto-resolve the incident?
* Incident templates?
